PySpark is a library for processing data with Apache Spark in Python. It provides the APIs for using spark functionality within python or in a standalone pyspark command line.

## Installing the PySpark library

Installing the library is easy because it's distributed with the pip package manager. This means that you can install the PySpark library directly with the following command:

`pip install pyspark`{{execute}}

## Test installation

To test the installation, execute the following command in the terminal:

`pyspark`{{execute}}

This will open the PySpark shell in the terminal. If there isn't any error, everything went well and pyspark was installed successfully using pip.

Stop the pyspark cli with CTRL+C.
