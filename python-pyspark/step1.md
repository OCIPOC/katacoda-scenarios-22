"Apache Sparkâ„¢ is a multi-language engine for executing data engineering, data science, and machine learning on single-node machines or clusters." [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org)

Spark is a unified analytics engine for big data and machine learning. It is the most widely used engine for scalable computing with thousands of companies using Apache Spark [1].

## Benefits of Spark

Spark can be up to 100x faster than Hadoop on processing large amounts of data. Furthermore, Spark has easy-to-use APIs with over 100 operators for working with data. It also includes support for higher-level operations like SQL queries, streaming data and machine learning [2].

## Using Spark

Apache Spark is written in Scala programming language but provides APIs for different programming languages like Python, Java and R [1].
