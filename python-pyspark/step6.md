In this step you will learn why you should use pyspark instead of pandas.

In very simple words Pandas run operations on a single machine whereas PySpark runs on multiple machines. If you are working on a Machine Learning application where you are dealing with larger datasets, PySpark is a best fit which could processes operations many times(100x) faster than Pandas [7].
